🌍 30 Day Map Challenge — 2025

Welcome to my #30DayMapChallenge repository!
This challenge is a global, community-driven GIS event where participants create and share one map each day for 30 days, following daily themes.

This repo documents my journey through the challenge, showcasing maps made with QGIS, Python, and open geospatial datasets.
